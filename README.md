# Public_Health_Analysis

We created a machine learning program that automates the detection of at-risk populations across the United States for public-health research. We used a clustering algorithm to detect multimodal distubutions in the populations. We also used supervised learning and genetic programming to generalize our risk classification to new populations and conduct feature extraction, respectively. This will help insurance companies or policy makers detect emerging at-risk areas with regard to public-health problems. This project was sumbitted at MedHacks 2018 at Johns Hopkins University.
