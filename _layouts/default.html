        <div id="Project Background"><h2>Project Background</h2>
          <p>The queer population presents a complex intersectional range of identities that too commonly go unnoticed by well-meaning data scientists and public-health advocates who simply do not understand queer identity. Indeed, queer identity in many places is designed to be subtle because of the mistrust or danger of being open about one’s sexuality, which leads the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27272643">majority of queer youth</a> to not disclose their minority identity to clinicians. There are obvious advances to be made in the public health of the LGBT community, as well as improvements to be made in the distribution of gay-specialist clinicians that can be effective in improving the health of the community and attenuating expensive emergency services by a neglected LGBT population. </p>

          <div id="Technical Overview"><h2>Technical Overview</h2><p></p></div>

            <p>We propose a novel technique in which machine learning helps queer-knowledgeable data-scientists glean information about the queer community present in general public-health datasets where information about sexuality and gender expression is not explicitly included by exploiting the generalization of common queer sociological story arcs.

            <blockquote style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.45; position: relative; color: #383838;"> We enable queer-knowledgeable data-scientists to glean information about the queer community present in general public-health datasets where information about sexuality and gender expression is not explicitly included by exploiting the generalization of common queer sociological story arcs.</blockquote><br>

          An <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK64802/">Institute of Medicine Special Committee</a> states that the difficulty of obtaining information about the LGBT community and simply defining queer people impedes specialized research on minority health. Indeed, defining what it means to be queer is so difficult that many sociologists are divided over whether it is beneficial to embrace the term queer (in its meaning abnormal), or whether it is better to move into a post-queer theory that offers a more intersectional view of LGBT individuals. These complexities make it necessary for impassioned public-health advocates to apply their knowledge of the queer experience in order to draw conclusions from big-data in a way that leverages their knowledge of the complexities of intersectional identity and its interplay with personal health to affect betterment of the community. Specifically, we apply our knowledge of what it means to be at-risk queer to identify whether hot-spots of medical spending are likely to be caused by a gay subpopulation in our first example. It is likely that this technique could immediately be put to use by applied research groups such as the Blue Cross Blue Shield institute in an effort to reduce claims by the LGBT population. Furthermore, the idea applies more generally to any group which needs to identify the “mixed signal” of queer subpopulations within larger communities.

        <div id="Challenges in Classification"><h2>Challenges in Classification</h2><p>
          Classification problems are always prone to overfitting, the effect of a classifier learning the training data too accurately and therefore not being able to generalize well on new data. To prevent this in the decision tree we employed a method known as pruning, whereby the tree's depth is limited to prevent too specific of a classification. In the neural network on the other hand, we limited the number of hidden nodes and trained for less epochs to prevent overfitting.

          As for the neural network specifically, obtaining more expressive features for the network was a problem, as data was limited. To solve this we used an open-source genetic programming framework called EMADE to do feature extraction and augmentation, however this method did not yield results in our limited timeframe. For future users who have trouble with feature extraction, however, this may be a viable option.

        <div id="Machine Learning on Intersectional Queer Identity"><h2>Machine Learning on Intersectional Queer Identity</h2><p>
          We used two types of machine learning classifiers on our dataset - a decision tree with pruning and a neural network. The decision tree is advantageous because it allows users to very clearly see the decomposition of the classification (i.e. it allows the user to specifically see what features classified a person as queer or not). This serves the interests of insurance companies or policymakers who rely on feature information like this to make important decisions. A neural network on the other hands, while sometimes better at accurate classification, makes it very difficult to visualize what features were important in that classification without specicalized knowledge. Becuase the decision tree is more descriptive in this way, it is more legally admissible in situations requiring explanation for classification results. This will also help prevent ethical problems in misclassification, such as what happened in the instance of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/07/congress-wants-immediate-meeting-with-amazon-to-talk-facial-recognition/">Amazon AI misclassifying African American members of Congress</a>.

          Our decision tree classifier was able to identify several important features in classifying queer individuals. These include education level, sex, transgender identity, and HIV status. These features were important because they vielded the greated information gain (defined from an information theory perspective) out of any features in the classifier. It is important to have these and other specific features identified from the classifier to that they can be defended in peer reviewed literature. Below is an image of our decision tree. The X values at the top of each blow correspond to the columns in our dataset "at_risk_queer.csv" with column indexing starting from 0.

          A visual if our neural network is shown below. As you can see, while the general structure of the network is defined, there is no indication of which features propogate information in specific directions through the netowkr without explicitly calculting their weighted values, and it becomes clear that decision trees are much more transparent.

          Both our decision tree and our neural network were able to generalize to data they had not see before, indicating that these trends in the classification of queer individuals would hold in other settings, which is an important to both insurance companies and policymakers. Below we see the training process and a graph of accuracy against training epochs.

          <p>The classifier we created can be used by public health campaigns for Queer-directed marketing strategies. For example, the FDA released an anti-smoking ad campaign targeted towards the queer community called This Free Life.

            <blockquote style="font-size: 9px; font-style: italic; line-height: 0.9; position: relative; color: #383838;"> An example of a targeted ad campaign that used results from queer data science studies</blockquote><br>            
            Apart from smoking, data predicted from our classifier regarding other pressing health issues could also have a beneficial impact and target a large and newly emerging market.
            Our classifier will also be useful for public health researchers and insurance companies in America so that they can develop programs such as gay clinics or queer protection in communities, based on the data predicted from our classifier.
            Internationally, the scope goes beyond business. In many countries, queer identity is not, or has just recently been legalized (for example, homosexuality has just been legalized in India). In these countries, research into queer health is just now starting, and our research can have a great impact.
