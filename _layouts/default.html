      <p>The queer population presents a complex intersectional range of identities that too commonly go unnoticed by well-meaning data scientists and public-health advocates who simply do not understand queer identity. Indeed, queer identity in many places is designed to be subtle because of the mistrust or danger of being open about one’s sexuality, which leads the majority of queer youth to not disclose their minority identity to clinicians [ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27272643 ]. There are obvious advances to be made in the public health of the LGBT community, as well as improvements to be made in the distribution of gay-specialist clinicians that can be effective in improving the health of the community and attenuating expensive emergency services by a neglected LGBT population. We propose a novel technique in which machine learning helps queer-knowledgeable data-scientists glean information about the queer community present in general public-health datasets where information about sexuality and gender expression is not explicitly included by exploiting the generalization of common queer sociological story arcs.

BIG ASS QUOTE: queer-knowledgeable data-scientists glean information about the queer community present in general public-health datasets where information about sexuality and gender expression is not explicitly included by exploiting the generalization of common queer sociological story arcs

             An Institute of Medicine Special Committee [ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK64802/ ] states that the difficulty of obtaining information about the LGBT community and simply defining queer people impedes specialized research on minority health. Indeed, defining what it means to be queer is so difficult that many sociologists are divided over whether it is beneficial to embrace the term queer (in its meaning abnormal), or whether it is better to move into a post-queer theory that offers a more intersectional view of LGBT individuals. These complexities make it necessary for impassioned public-health advocates to apply their knowledge of the queer experience in order to draw conclusions from big-data in a way that leverages their knowledge of the complexities of intersectional identity and its interplay with personal health to affect betterment of the community. Specifically, we apply our knowledge of what it means to be at-risk queer to identify whether hot-spots of medical spending are likely to be caused by a gay subpopulation in our first example. It is likely that this technique could immediately be put to use by applied research groups such as the Blue Cross Blue Shield institute in an effort to reduce claims by the LGBT population. Furthermore, the idea applies more generally to any group which needs to identify the “mixed signal” of queer subpopulations within larger communities.
