        <div id="Project Background"><h2>Project Background</h2>
          <p>The queer population presents a complex intersectional range of identities that too commonly go unnoticed by well-meaning data scientists and public-health advocates who do not tailor their analyses to the complexities of the queer community. Indeed, queer identity in many places is designed to be subtle because of the mistrust or danger of being open about one’s sexuality, which may lead the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27272643">majority of queer youth</a> to not disclose their minority identity to clinicians. There are obvious advances to be made in the public health of the LGBT community, as well as improvements to be made in the distribution of gay-specialist clinicians that can be effective in improving the health of the community and attenuating expensive emergency services by a neglected LGBT population. </p>

          <blockquote style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.45; position: relative; color: #383838;">The queer population presents a complex intersectional range of identities that too commonly go unnoticed by well-meaning data scientists and public-health advocates who do not tailor their analyses to the queer condition well enough to get the most from data where gay people are included as unlabeled members of a general population.</blockquote><br>

          <p>An <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK64802/">Institute of Medicine Special Committee</a> states that the difficulty of obtaining information about the LGBT community and simply defining queer people impedes specialized research on minority health. Indeed, defining what it means to be queer is so difficult that many sociologists are divided over whether it is beneficial to embrace the term queer (in its meaning abnormal), or whether it is better to move into a post-queer theory that offers a more intersectional view of LGBT individuals. These complexities make it necessary for impassioned public-health advocates to apply their knowledge of the queer experience in order to draw conclusions from big-data in a way that leverages their knowledge of the complexities of intersectional identity and its interplay with personal health to affect betterment of the community.  </p>

          <p>In our example of this technique, we apply our knowledge of what it means to be at-risk queer to identify whether hot-spots of medical spending are likely to be caused by a gay subpopulation. It is likely that this technique could immediately be put to use by applied research groups such as the Blue Cross Blue Shield Institute in an effort to reduce claims by the LGBT population. However, the technique applies more generally to any group which needs to identify the “mixed signal” of queer subpopulations within larger communities.</p>

          <div id="Technical Overview"><h2>Technical Overview</h2><p></p></div>


            <p>We propose a novel technique in which machine learning helps queer-knowledgeable data-scientists glean information about the queer community present in general public-health datasets where information about sexuality and gender expression is not explicitly included by exploiting the generalization of common queer sociological story arcs. First, a representative sample is taken where it is known which survey participants are queer. Then, machine learning identifies features that are present both in this data and a larger dataset of interest. The machine learner is trained on only a subset of identified queer participants, and then validated on a disjoint validation set. This ensures that observations generalize to a larger population of queer people united by common circumstance. In this way, public health researchers can take a small amount of data from a representative sample, and then generalize to larger databases that are not practical to recreate only for the study of queer health. </p>

            <p>Our group first tried to run a regression model to predict the percentage of the LGBT population in each country in California. The loose conglomeration of people who identify as queer was too general, and did not converge to anything other than trivial accuracy; our first algorithm guessed the queer population at random because there were no features that correlated with being queer. We outline this in our Challenges in Classification subsection.</p>

            <p>Subsequently in the Machine Learning on Intersectional Queer Identity, we focused our efforts on the at-risk subpopulation of queer people. Because these people present at clinics already seeking medical attention, we believe they are victims of discrimination and likely to bear some of the trauma that causes the LGBT population to exhibit higher incidences of some types of addiction, histories of abuse, and mental unhealth. Here, we do obtain a statistically important ability to identify queer people by training a decision tree to pivot on education level, gender, and HIV status. Because we have achieved a classifier that non-trivially identifies queer people and is validated by k-fold validation, we have the ability to pick out the queer population on a larger dataset with the same features but no labels saying whether a person is queer or not. Furthermore, Bayesian statistics can be used to reconstruct any observation (numerical or categorical) taken only from the gay subpopulation. This achieves our goal of statistically inferring the responses of queer people from larger datasets that do not implicitly label them.  <p>

        <div id="Challenges in Classification"><h2>Challenges in Classification</h2><p>
          Initially, we tried to use health data from different counties in order to extract the features that correlated the most with the queer population in those counties. However, neither a neural network nor a decision tree could find a statistically significant regression. We feel certain that the reason why this occurred is because the queer population was not united by any other the variables included in the dataset, which included the incidence of smoking, suicide rate, and incidence of STIs.  Thus, we moved to the next section wherein we targeted a specific gay story arc that unites a subpopulation within a dataset (in our case, the trauma and abuse that leads to poor health in the subset of the queer population that is especially at-risk due to these factors).
        </p>
        <p>Another problem faced in both stages of our development was overfitting, which is the effect of a classifier learning the training data too accurately and therefore not generalizing well on new data. To prevent this in the decision tree we employed a method known as pruning, whereby the tree's depth is limited to prevent too specific of a classification. In the neural network on the other hand, we limited the number of hidden nodes and trained for less epochs to prevent overfitting. </p></div>

          As previously mentioned, we now begin to focus our efforts on the at-risk gay subpopulation. We used a dataset available from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research [ https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/21520# ]. We used two types of machine learning classifiers on our dataset - a decision tree with pruning and a neural network. The decision tree is advantageous because it allows users to very clearly see the decomposition of the classification (i.e. it allows the user to specifically see what features classified a person as queer or not). This serves the interests of insurance companies or policymakers who rely on feature information like this to make important decisions. A neural network on the other hands, while sometimes better at accurate classification, makes it very difficult to visualize what features were important in that classification without specicalized knowledge. Becuase the decision tree is more descriptive in this way, it is more legally admissible in situations requiring explanation for classification results. This will also help prevent ethical problems in misclassification, such as what happened in the instance of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/07/congress-wants-immediate-meeting-with-amazon-to-talk-facial-recognition/">Amazon AI misclassifying African American members of Congress</a>.

          Our decision tree classifier was able to identify several important features in classifying queer individuals. These include education level, sex, transgender identity, and HIV status. It is important to have these and other specific features identified from the classifier to that they can be defended in peer reviewed literature.

          Both our decision tree and our neural network were able to generalize to data they had not see before, indicating that these trends in the classification of queer individuals would hold in other settings, which is an important to both insurance companies and policymakers.

          <p>We believe that there are many other intersectional groups that could benefit from this intersectional approach. What markers define Latinx queer youth, for example? </p>
          <p>Furthermore, last week's legalization of gay sex in India signals that there are many parts of the world where data collection and public-policy work may become a possibility over the next decades. We are excited to see how this work can be applied to historical datasets, which do not include information about sexuality, to provide context in this brave new world.  </p>
          <p>Also, we have developed another formal method that uses additional statistics (skew and measures of multimodality), which we argue are likely to signal minority populations if applied to a continuous dimension. </p>
